# JWT_DECODE
This script is a Python utility for decoding and inspecting JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It allows you to extract and view the header and payload information from a JWT without verifying its signature. Additionally, it checks for the expiration time (exp field) and determines if the token is still valid.
